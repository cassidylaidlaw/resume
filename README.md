# Cassidy Laidlaw's resume
*My resume, rendered by React*

This is a script I wrote using [React](https://reactjs.org/) and [react-pdf](https://react-pdf.org/) to generate my resume.

## Usage

 1. Clone the repository and run `yarn install`.
 2. Run `yarn render <options>`. Options can include:
 
     * `long`: generate a long, CV-style resume
     * `ai`: for AI-related jobs, puts AI experience section first
     * `personal`: include personal information like phone number and address (not included in GitHub)
     
    For instance, running `yarn render long ai` will render a long-format resume with the AI experience section first.
 3. Check `Cassidy Laidlaw resume.pdf` for the output!

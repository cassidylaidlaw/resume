# Cassidy Laidlaw's resume
*My resume, rendered by React*

This is a script I wrote using [React](https://reactjs.org/) and [react-pdf](https://react-pdf.org/) to generate my resume.

## Usage

 1. Clone the repository and run `yarn install`.
 2. Run `yarn render`.
 3. Check `Cassidy Laidlaw resume.pdf` for the output!
